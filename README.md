# Explainable Student Risk Prediction System

This project implements an explainable machine learning system to predict academic risk among students using behavioral and performance features.

The goal is to demonstrate responsible and transparent AI for decision support in education.

## Objectives
- Predict student academic risk using interpretable ML models
- Provide feature-level explanations for predictions
- Evaluate performance beyond accuracy (calibration, robustness)
- Support ethical and transparent AI usage

## Tech Stack
- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- SHAP (for explainability)

## Planned Workflow
1. Data preprocessing and feature engineering
2. Baseline ML model (logistic regression)
3. Enhanced model (random forest)
4. Explainability analysis
5. Evaluation and reporting
